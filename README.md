# JumpStart Georgia's StoryBuilder used for [Chai Khana's site](http://chai-khana.org).

## Summary
StoryBuilder is a web application that allows users to build mixed-media stories that can then be shared with the world. You can try StoryBuilder out for yourself [here](http://storybuilder.jumpstart.ge/en).

The idea for this application came after viewing mixed-media stories like this [New York Times story](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/). We wanted to be able to create stories like this without having to start from scratch for every story.  We wanted to be able to quickly put interactive, mixed-media stories together without having to require a lot of designer or developer time.  That is the goal of this application.


## How It Works
StoryBuilder is similar to a blog editor like wordpress or tumblr, but at this point is still a little rustic.  In essence, StoryBuilder allows you to add content, images, and/or videos into sections in a story that can be ordered however you want.

Right now there are four types of sections that can be created:
* Text: Simple text with a rich-text editor like Word or Google Docs.
* Embed Online Media: Add online video and audio from sites like youtube, vimeo and soundcloud.
* Full-Screen Media: This can be a combination of images and/or videos that will appear on the screen in a vertical slider format, one after the other.  The media is stretched to fill the users entire window and a small caption text can appear ontop of the media.
* Image Slideshow: Images in a simple horizontal slideshow.

Aside from building the story, you also have the ability to:
* clone a story as the beginning of a new story
* download a story so you can host it on any website
* embed a pretty link to the story
* embed the full story
* invite others to help collaborate on the story
* share a private URL to allow others to review your story before it is published
